Welcome to Discover Poland! This website was created to encourage more people to visit the ❤️ of Europe.

Poland is full of cities waiting to be discovered. No matter what you're interested in, Poland has it. Museums, fantastic nature and architecture, modern and old constructions, beautiful rivers and mountains in the south.

The website is divided into a few parts, for your convenience:
- A front page, with the newest tourist information
- A comprehensive page about six cities in Poland
- A blog (you are here!)
- And an about page for those interested to learn more about the project

Maybe you're interested in learning more about the cities? Head to the map on the front page. Or, maybe you want to start browsing attractions? Head to the cities page, and select a city which seems interesting!

Enjoy discovering Poland!
